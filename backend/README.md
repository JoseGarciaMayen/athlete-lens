# Backend

FastAPI backend for Athlete Lens. Handles video analysis, data persistence, and the REST API consumed by the frontend.

## API endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/health` | Liveness check |
| `GET` | `/api/athlete` | Get athlete profile |
| `PUT` | `/api/athlete` | Update athlete profile (name, weight, height) |
| `GET` | `/api/sessions` | List all sessions |
| `POST` | `/api/sessions` | Create a session |
| `GET` | `/api/dashboard` | Best metric per session (for charts) |
| `GET` | `/api/metrics` | All metrics, sorted by date desc |
| `DELETE` | `/api/metrics/vertical/{id}` | Delete a vertical metric |
| `DELETE` | `/api/metrics/horizontal/{id}` | Delete a horizontal metric |
| `DELETE` | `/api/metrics/sprint/{id}` | Delete a sprint metric |
| `POST` | `/api/analyze/vertical` | Analyse vertical jump video |
| `POST` | `/api/analyze/sprint` | Analyse sprint video |
| `POST` | `/api/analyze/horizontal` | Save horizontal jump (manual entry) |

All video endpoints accept `multipart/form-data`. They also accept a manual value (`jump_height_cm` / `sprint_time_s`) to skip video processing.

## Key design decisions

### YOLOv8 instead of MediaPipe

The original design used MediaPipe. MediaPipe 0.10.x dropped the `mp.solutions` API entirely, and the last version that supported it (`0.10.14`) has no wheels for Python 3.12+. Switched to `ultralytics` (YOLOv8n-pose), which supports modern Python and is actively maintained.

### GPU auto-detection

At startup `lifespan` checks `torch.cuda.is_available()` and stores the result in `app.state.device`. Both extractors receive `device` as a parameter. CPU fallback processes a typical video in ~10 s, which is acceptable for personal-use frequency.

### Synchronous endpoints

Routes are defined as `def`, not `async def`. Video analysis is CPU-bound and blocking. `async def` would block the event loop just as much without any benefit; `def` lets FastAPI run the handler in a thread pool, which is the correct pattern for synchronous I/O-heavy work.

### Model loaded once at startup

`app.state.model = YOLO("yolov8n-pose.pt")` in the `lifespan` handler. Loading YOLOv8 takes ~1–2 s; doing it per-request would be unacceptable. The same `app.state.device` string is also set there and passed to every analysis call.

### `{success, error}` error contract

All functions in `core/*/extractor.py` return dicts: `{"success": True, ...data}` or `{"success": False, "error": "..."}`. Python exceptions would be more idiomatic, but this pattern was established early and kept consistent across all modules.

### SQLite, no migrations

Single-user app, single machine. SQLite requires no server. Schema changes are handled by dropping and recreating the database with a manual backup. Alembic would add complexity not justified by the use case.

### No authentication

Single-user, local installation. If exposed via Cloudflare Tunnel, access can be restricted at the network layer (Cloudflare Access / Zero Trust) without touching the application code.

### `fps` parameter on video endpoints

`MediaRecorder` (the browser API used for recording) does not embed a valid FPS value in the WebM container; the metadata often reads as 1000 or 0. Both `/analyze/vertical` and `/analyze/sprint` accept an optional `fps` form field. When provided, it overrides the value read from video metadata. The frontend reads `videoTrack.getSettings().frameRate` before uploading and sends it as `fps`.

### `distance_m` stored per metric, not per session

`SprintMetric.distance_m` lives on the metric row, not on the session. This allows multiple sprint distances in the same session. The `/api/dashboard` endpoint groups separately by distance.

### `get_or_create_session` by `(athlete_id, date)`

Submitting multiple metrics on the same day reuses the same session row. Session notes are set by the first metric of the day; subsequent submissions on the same date ignore the `notes` field.

## Development setup

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
uv run uvicorn api.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Running tests

```bash
uv run pytest -m "not integration"   # fast, no fixtures needed
uv run pytest                         # all tests (requires video fixtures)
```
